### **Input Variable**

1. **BUSINESS_DESCRIPTION**:  
   {{BUSINESS_DESCRIPTION}}

---

### **Objective**

Generate **exactly 50 unique business names**, each with one or more associated domains, by leveraging a hybrid approach that combines a large initial pool with iterative fallback handling.

---

### **Instructions**

#### **1. Analyze Business Description and Extract Core Themes**  

- **Interpret BUSINESS_DESCRIPTION:**  
  - If the supplied business description isn't understood or looks inaccurate, stop now and notify the user while asking for clarification before proceeding.
  - Identify and extract core themes, concepts, and values.
  - Determine implied or explicit style and tone (e.g., modern, playful, professional).

---

#### **2. Generate Initial Pool**  

- Create an **initial pool of at least 150 domain suggestions**, ensuring:
  - **Use Relevant Nouns, Verbs, and Adjectives:**  
    Extract and utilize relevant nouns, verbs, and adjectives implied from the business description to form the foundation of the business names.
  
  - **Create Portmanteaus, Blended Words, and Playful or Spell-Altered Forms:**  
    Develop unique and creative business names by combining words (portmanteaus), blending parts of different words, or using playful spell-alterations to enhance memorability and brand appeal.
  
  - **Ensure Terms are Short and Memorable for Brand Resonance:**  
    Focus on creating concise and catchy names that are easy to remember and resonate well with the target audience.
  
  - **Explore Expansions for Clarity Using Prefixes/Suffixes:**  
    Add clarity and context to business names by incorporating relevant prefixes or suffixes such as “go,” “ly,” “hub,” “biz,” "foundation," "shopping," or "info."
  
  - **Maintain Variety in Structure and TLDs:**  
    - A variety of prefixes, suffixes, and structures (e.g., portmanteaus, blended words, slight misspellings).
    - Diverse TLDs (e.g., .com, .io, .tech, .org).
    - A mix of creative and descriptive options.

- **Domain Availability Tactics**:  
  - **Insert Prefixes/Suffixes:**  
    Utilize the following categories and examples when appropriate:
    1. **Designators (Business Entity Identifiers):**  
       - *Examples:* Corporation, LLC, Inc., Ltd., Solutions, Ventures.
    2. **Modifiers (Nature, Purpose, or Scope):**  
       - *Examples:* Global, Tech, Digital, Smart.
    3. **Geographic Indicators:**  
       - *Examples:* Midwest, Pacific, Ontario.
    4. **Industry Terms:**  
       - *Examples:* Healthcare, Energy, Finance, Consulting.
    5. **Creative Elements (Brand Differentiation):**  
       - *Examples:* BlueSky, Infinity, Spark.
    6. **Ownership or Legacy Terms:**  
       - *Examples:* & Co., & Partners.
    7. **Acronyms/Initialisms:**  
       - *Examples:* ABC, XYZ.
    8. **Partnership Markers:**  
       - *Examples:* & Partners, & Associates.
    9. **Hybrid Elements:**  
       - *Examples:* Summit Global Consulting, NorthStar Ventures.
    10. **Domain Considerations:**  
        - *Examples:* Keep names concise, align domain extensions (e.g., .com, .tech).

  - **Slight Misspellings/Phonetic Twists:**  
    - *Examples:* chainly, cooki.

  - **Portmanteaus/Blends:**  
    - *Examples:* FitFlex, BodyZoom.

  - **Explore Alternative TLDs:**  
    - *Examples:* .net, .co, .ai., .tech (if relevant)

  - **Filter Likely Collisions:**  
    - Exclude common words and heavily trademarked zones.

---

#### **3. Deduplicate and Consolidate**

- Deduplicate business names in the pool.
- Consolidate domains for duplicates into a single row, with a comma-separated list under **Domain Name(s)**.

---

#### **4. Apply Filtering Criteria**

- Enforce rules:
  - **Length**: 6–25 characters (excluding TLD).
  - **Structure**: No hyphens, numbers, or invalid characters.
  - **TLD Relevance**: Prioritize .com, .net, .io, .tech, and trending options like .ai.
- Ensure all rows:
  - Contain a valid business name.
  - Have at least one associated domain.

---

#### **5. Rank, Filter, and Sort Domains Using Domain Selection Criteria**

- **Reference [DOMAIN SELECTION CRITERIA]:**  
  - Apply the predefined criteria to each potential domain to compute final scores.
  - **Filter Out:**  
    - Domains flagged for dictionary/trademark issues.
    - Domains with low TLD scores.
  - **Weight TLD Selection:**  
    - Assign tiered scoring based on TLD popularity and relevance.
  - **Sort Output:**  
    - Present final name suggestions in descending order of calculated domain score.
    - Ensure each business name appears only once in the output. If duplicates exist:
      - Collapse duplicates by combining their domain names into a single row with a comma-separated list.

---

#### **6. Validate Row Count**

- If fewer than 50 rows:
  - Regenerate additional suggestions.
  - Expand the keyword pool.
  - Loosen filtering constraints (e.g., allow creative misspellings or less common TLDs).
  - Repeat steps 3–5 until exactly 50 rows are achieved.

---

#### **7. Output Final Table**

Present results in a structured table:

- **Domain Name(s):** Comma-separated list for consolidated rows.
- **Business Name:** Unique name for the business.
- **Acronym:** Short, relevant acronym for the business.

---

### **[DOMAIN SELECTION CRITERIA]**

1. **Value-Based Scoring**  
   - Higher final score = more valuable + more likely unregistered.  
   - Each category yields positive/negative points; final sum = overall value score.  
   - Filter out certain domains outright (e.g., ccTLDs).

2. **Structural Validity and Length**  
   - 6–15 chars → +10  
   - 3–5 → –4  
   - 16–25 → –4  
   - Invalid structure (leading/trailing hyphens, repeating chars) → –5  
   - **Total Structural** = sum.

3. **TLD Compatibility and Filtering**  
   - Tier 1 (.com, .net, .org) → +12  
   - Tier 2 (.info, .biz, .co) → +8  
   - Tier 3 (.xyz, .online, .site) → +5  
   - Trending (.ai, .dev) → +7  
   - gTLD Boost → +2 if TLD is gTLD  
   - **Filter out:** ccTLDs; Tier 1 if length = 3–5 (excl. TLD).  
   - **TLD Score** = base + gTLD boost.

4. **Keyword Relevance**  
   - Direct match → +7  
   - Partial/fuzzy → +2  
   - Semantically related → +2  
   - gTLD strongly related → +5  
   - Forced expansions → –3 each.  
   - **Keyword total** = sum.

5. **Dictionary/Trademark Checks**  
   - Exact dictionary → –10  
   - Exact trademark → –15 or exclude  
   - Partial dictionary → –5  
   - Partial trademark → –8  
   - **Dictionary/Trademark total** = sum.

6. **Repetition/Pattern Avoidance**  
   - Organicness scale = 0–3  
   - Score = –(scale × 3).  
   - **Repetition total** = negative per scale.

7. **Composite**  
   - Multiply each category:  
     - Structural ×2  
     - TLD Compatibility ×2  
     - Keyword Relevance ×1.5  
     - Dictionary/Trademark ×2.5  
     - Repetition/Pattern ×1.5  
     - Additional Heuristics/History ×2 (if relevant).  
   - **Sum** → Final Value.  
   - **Post-calculation:**  
     - If Dictionary/Trademark total < –10, final –5.  
     - If TLD < 5, final –2.  
   - **Sort** descending by final score; tiebreak = domain length / TLD priority.

8. **TLD-Specific Heuristics**  
   - Fold “popular-saturated” TLD adjustments into base.  
   - Update trending TLDs monthly.  
   - If TLD is “premium”/scarce, –3 from final.  
   - Exclude ccTLDs fully.

### **Structured and Deterministic Output**

- **Output Format:**  
  Provide a structured list where each entry includes:
  1. **Domain Name(s):** The suggested domain(s), comma-separated if multiple (e.g., `FitFlex.com, FitFlex.io`)
  2. **Business Name:** The unique brand name derived from the domain (e.g., `FitFlex`).
  3. **Acronym:** A relevant acronym for the business (e.g., `FF`).

**Example Output:** (Note: The output should always include 50 unique rows, even though the example below shows only a subset for brevity.)

| Domain Name                       | Business Name | Acronym |
|-----------------------------------|---------------|---------|
| FitFlex.com, FitFlex.io           | FitFlex       | FF      |
| BodyZoom.com, BodyZoom.tech       | BodyZoom      | BZ      |
| VibePeak.net, VibePeak.online     | VibePeak      | VP      |
